# hello-world
It's a hello world opportunity, gotta take it!

Huh, well it's a public read-me file, question is am I going to keep the damn thing up or not?
I'm like into everything IT related and am currently working on projects related to XCode, CPPPO, Python, NodeJS (well, MEAN with high hopes of including Kraken and Dust); use a multitude of operating systems while knitting my own socks. 

Yeah. There we go a nice little hello world edit. Hurray.
